                            //     This section is technically a complicated section due to limitation of the carousel slider. We created two divs to mask the left side where the first div contains the bg color of the previous/ overlapped section and the second and third one is light blue. If you use a different bg color on the previous/ overlapped section you need to add "data-bg-color="COLOR VALUE OF PREVIOUS SECTION BG COLOR" attribute to the first div. And gradient color might not work well.

                            Resilience
                        </h2>
                        <p class="mb-5">Industrial operations are increasingly under threat as OT (Operational
                            Technology) attacks become more common and severe. IT-borne threats, particularly
                            ransomware, have had a devastating impact on industrial environments, causing major
                            disruptions, including operational shutdowns, lost revenue, and high remediation costs. This
                            has pushed cybersecurity to the forefront for industrial operators.
                            <br>
                            Spending on OT cybersecurity is expected to grow, but implementing effective solutions
                            presents challenges, notably the siloed nature of OT and IT teams which leads to
                            misalignment in cybersecurity decision-making. Although integration is progressing, cohesive
                            decision-making for cybersecurity remains crucial.
